## Project Development & Planning
Throughout the development of this game I followed the principles of User Experience (UX), including the 5 planes of Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton & Surface. At all times I wanted to make sure that the website was easy to use, responsive, accessible and intuitive as well as meeting the goals and needs of the user and client.

### Project Goals

#### **Project Purpose**
A web-based quiz that allows users to learn more about their 'travel personality' and recommends a destination for them to visit based on their answers.

#### **Client Goals**
The quiz was built as a milestone project on my Diploma in Web Application Development with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) as a learning tool for interactive frontend development and my first project using JavaScript and so didn't have a specific client.
However in order to make the end product more professional and to help with create a clear scope for the project I treated it as a real-world application which could be used by a travel agency or travel blogger, with a focus on more exotic or lesser known destinations. This client's goals would be:
* Engaging users with interactivity and a fun application on their site
* Allowing users to learn more about lesser-known destinations
* Helping users to choose where to go
* Helping users learn more about their travel personality

#### **User Goals**
The audience for this quiz would be people who are looking to travel or go on holiday but are unsure where to go. They perhaps want to experience more exotic destinations or want to go somewhere off the beaten track and wish to find a destination that would suit their personality and tastes.
Their main goals would be:
* Learning more about themselves and their travel personality
* Having fun doing a short quiz
* Getting recommendations of where to go travelling or on holiday
* Learning more about a lesser-known destination that suits their travel personality


### Research

#### **Market Review**
I looked at a variety of online travel quizzes. Most were hosted by travel agencies or travel bloggers. I looked at the style and content of their questions and answers, how the results were presented, the design and style of the websites and how the quiz was structured. I also looked more broadly at personality tests. Some of the websites that I researched are below.

[Conde Nast Quiz](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/where-should-you-go-on-vacation-next) | [Jessie On A Journey](https://jessieonajourney.com/travel-personality-quiz/) | [Inspiring Travel](https://www.inspiringtravel.co.uk/other-shores/on-trend/holiday-destination-quiz/) | [British Airways](https://bahighlife.com/destinations/quiz-which-holiday-destination-is-right-for-you) | [Truity](https://www.truity.com/test/travel-personality-test) | [16 Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com)

#### **Key Takeaways from Market Review**
* 10 questions is a good length to keep a user's interest
* Most questions were about travel though some focused more on personality
* Many of the quizzes featured simple animations on hover or click
* Most of the quizzes didn't offer a back button to change an answer

DETAILS OF BUGS (Link to bugs below?)

### Bugs & Fixes

During development and testing, in addition to the improvements described in the validation section above, I encountered the following bugs:

#### **Inset Shadow stopped click on map**

After adding an inset shadow on the map using a ::before element created in CSS I realised it had disabled any interaction with the map. After some research I discovered I needed to disable pointer events on the overlay and enable it on the map again in order to click through and interact with the map.

```
#map {
    pointer-events: all;
}

#map::before {
    pointer-events: none;
}
```

#### **Google Map API on mobile & Safari - border-radius**

After deploying the site to GitHub pages and viewing on mobile and in Safari the Google Maps API was not contained within the div's border radius rounded corners. After investigating the issue using Dev tools and searching online I worked out that the issue related to the way that Google Maps API builds the HTML for the map, it creates a series of divs enclosed in each other and on certain browsers the border radius and overflow were not translating down in to these divs. I tried targeting all descendent divs, however I ran in to an issue where the overflow:hidden caused the map to disappear completely. After trial and error I discovered I needed to target the 2nd level of div with the CSS styling and this solved the issue.

```
#map > div > div {
    overflow: hidden;
    border-radius: 24px;
    -webkit-border-radius: 24px;
    -moz-border-radius: 24px;
    -o-border-radius: 24px;
}
```

#### **Website not scrolling to top on reload & button click**

The website failed to scroll to the top when clicking on a button, this caused particular problems on mobile where less of the game was visible at once. I overcame this issue with the following techniques:

* Adding `<script>history.scrollRestoration = "manual"</script>` to the head element of the HTML file to turn off the automatic browser scroll settings.
* Adding `window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })` to the button clicks with a timeout to match the timeout on the button deselection.

#### **Mobile input zoom-in not resetting**

During testing on mobile, when selecting the name input box, the browser would zoom in make the box bigger. This was due to the input box having text smaller than 16px. However upon input the browser wasn't zooming out again. I fixed this by adding the following to the viewport data in the head element of the HTML code: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1">.
I wanted to make sure that accessibility wasn't affected by over-riding the zoom so I also increased the size of the name input box and start button.

#### **Button colour on mobile**

I found that the button text colour on mobile was set to blue rather than black, presumably as a result of this being a clickable button. I fixed this by explicitly setting the color of the button text in the CSS.

#### **Google Maps API - Console Errors**

On page load Dev Tool's console was logging a series of errors relating to Google Maps API.

**Error 1**
<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="">

</details>

This error was also stopping the map from loading. I fixed this by changing the order that the `<script>` files were called in the index.html file footer. The Google Maps API script had to be called after the map.js file containing the initmap function as in the code below.

**Index.html Footer - script files order**

```
    <script src="assets/js/questions_array.js"></script>
    <script src="assets/js/countries_array.js"></script>
    <script src="assets/js/personalities_array.js"></script>
    <script src="assets/js/map.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.2.1/dist/chart.umd.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@googlemaps/markerclusterer/dist/index.min.js"></script>
    <script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyBp3bbw0F5d1sjzp5iet_vlxKb0RrevMCA&callback=initMap"></script>
    <script src="assets/js/quiz.js"></script>
```

**Error 2**
<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="">

</details>

This error was due to the initMap function not being fed an index value from the countries array as it hadn't been calculated yet. I overcame this using an if statement at the start of the initMap function that checked if the parameter was undefined (ie it hadn't been given a value yet) and if so it gave it the value of 0 to load the first country in the countries array. This got rid of the console error.
I found and adapted this solution from [here](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/javascript-default-parameters/#:~:text=Setting%20JavaScript%20default%20parameters%20for,the%20default%20values%20of%20undefined%20.). (Credited in code comments.)


**Error 3**
<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="">

</details>

Upon load the Google Maps API was causing a number of warnings on the Dev Tools console relating to non-passive event handlers. I researched what was causing this and it appeared to be within the code of the Google Maps API and Google Chrome's Dev Tools being sensitive to non-passive event listeners. The JavaScript written within the API wasn't something I could access in order to make the event handlers passive. I was unable to find a solution to these warnings despite extensive searching online and using Code Institute's tutor support.

#### **Console Errors with Chart.js**

On page load Dev Tool's console was logging an error and failing to load the pie chart.

*After*

</details>

I found the solution to this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ens3HK88h5E). It was happenning because the CDN link I was using to the chart.js library was out of date and I needed to update it to a more recent version - as in the code below.


```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.2.1/dist/chart.umd.min.js"></script>
```
