Another major attraction is boat safaris, especially during the park's rainy season. As the Luangwa River breaks its banks, shallow-draft vessels can navigate into the flooded riverine groves - this is undoubtedly one of Zambia's most unique and exciting safari highlights!",

The depth of the centre of Lake Kashiba is however unknown, which has given rise to several mystical tales and legends of monsters below the surface.
